![example](https://github.com/fokolo/family-tree/raw/master/docs/main.png)

## Features
1. The Family Tree React Flow automatically arranges families based on their inner relationships. This ensures a clear and organized representation of your family tree, making it easy to navigate and understand.

2. Support for Complex Couples - Handle complex family structures such as divorces, shared kids, and other intricate relationships. The tool is designed to accommodate various family dynamics, allowing you to accurately capture the complexity of your family connections.

3. Maintained Generations - Generations are visually maintained, providing a clear distinction between different family layers. This feature enhances the overall readability of the family tree, making it easy to trace the lineage through multiple generations.

4. Color-Coded Family Edges - Each family edge is assigned a unique color, helping you distinguish between different branches of your family. This visual cue aids in quickly identifying and understanding the relationships within your family tree.

5. Non-Colliding Edges with Offset - To enhance the clarity of your family tree, edges are arranged to avoid collisions. An offset is applied to edges to prevent overlapping, ensuring that the connections are clearly visible and easy to follow.

6. Portrait Image support - Include images to personalize your family tree. You can easily add images to represent family members, creating a more engaging and visually appealing representation of your family connections. Simply replace placeholder images with your own to customize the appearance.
